# The Performance of Water Rockets

This repo contains files relating to our CREST project submission.
The raw audio files are within the raw-data folder and our online scraper and plotter was `scraper.js` and `plot.py`.
The writeup folder contains the code required to compile our data and the output pdf.
We have compiled our code online using overleaf using lualatex as the compiler.
