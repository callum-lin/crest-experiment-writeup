## This folder contains all raw data used in the process of conducting and making our report.

Each subfolder here is labelled by the date they were taken to help with referencing.

Each audio file is timestamped in the format of YYYYMMDD-hhmmss.

Each video file also contains a similar timestamp.

### NOTE: THIS IS RAW DATA WITH NO EXTRA PROCESSING OR COMMENTS!

#### We have put all raw data files regardless of their readability meaning that some files here are not used in the final report.

#### Due to the fact that the data was processed within the same day/next day and these files are after-the-fact archived uploads, while every effort has been made to ensure the files are relevant and are what we say they are, we cannot guarantee with any level of certainty that there are no duplicates, missing files, erroneous files etc.

#### The sheer number of files especially given that these files are uploaded months after the practical experiment means we also cannot label these individual files to a degree of accuracy we feel comfortable with -- thus there are no comments or results explaining the meaning of each file.

#### If such further infomation is needed, please contact us, we can say with partial certainty which files correspond to which corresponding variable but for results please refer to our main writeup.

#### As these are our own results they have little impact on the replicability of our experiment so labelling these individually to a high degree of confidence was not a focus point for us.

#### The experiement was done in a consistent order (usually 0L + repeats -> UPPER_LIMIT + repeats) with some files having voices of the volumes of water used at the start.

### Again we emphasise, the sheer number and age of these files means we cannot guarantee any form of assurance of anything regarding the files.

## Time spent discrepency

The timestamps here may/will not align with the timestamps we provide for the length of time we did the experiment for due to several factors:

- Data analysis was not instant, this meant a large chunk of work was "lost".
- Time spent preparing and setiing up the workspace was not recorded.
- Time spent packing away and distance travelled was not taken into account.
- Time spent between runs measuring out liquids etc. was not taken into account.
- Data analysis step (which could be lengthy depending on the quality of the recording) was very time consuming.
